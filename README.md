# Robot Template

A template for starting a new project using RIT-VEX-U's core library.

Includes:
- Core library (as a subtree)
- Eigen linear algebra library (as a submodule)
- A github action to test compilation

## Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone the repository
3. Open the repository in VSCode (or any other editor if you don't need the VSCode extension)

### Troubleshooting
If simply opening the folder in VSCode does not work, try navigating to the VEX extension panel and importing this folder
